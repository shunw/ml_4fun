    "- the Answer is no: because with the same model, the creat year may be different, which means the battery or other performance of the car is also different. So, I will drop the model col and more forcus on the time and vehicle classes\n",

    "  - kW (Power): Measures the motor's instantaneous strength (like the size of a water hose's flow).\n",
    "  - kWh (Energy): Measures the battery capacity or \"tank size\" (like the total amount of water in a bucket). \n"
